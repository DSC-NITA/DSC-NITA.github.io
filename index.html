        <h3>Hi! </h3><h4> Potential DSC member :)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          Thanks for applying to the <strong> DSC NIT-Agartala</strong>.
I hope that you loved the <strong>"Root-Node Challenge"</strong>  (yes, it had a name :P)... and I am extremely sorry if you didn't, actually the challenge was supposed to be a LOT more interesting (running on a dedicated backend server and involving complex cryptography, Image processing, and some calculus), but I had to design all the posters, draft all the messages and do a hell lot of other formalities... so I was not able to spice things up in the challenge :(.  Nevertheless, I'd love to hear from you, please spare 2 mins of your precious time to fill the feedback form <a href="https://forms.gle/cJ4ffZ1jGFnxFi6r8" target="__blank">HERE</a></p>
        </br>
<p>
<strong>And now talking about the recruitment process.</strong> <br>
Seriously, I have received waaaaayyyy too many responses than I expected. Glad to see that you guys are so much interested in joining the DSC, even amidst this pandemic. So coming to the important part... your RESUME, LinkedIn profile, and everything else will be reviewed by DSC Leads of <strong>OTHER</strong>  Institutes, to ensure fair play. Looking at the amount of application form... this may take a while. 
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>
Now I want to clear a few things:<br></strong>
<strong>1) Please don't ping me regarding the DSC :(</strong> , as I said earlier DSC is NOT like other clubs, here if someone knows even slightly more than you then he will be preferred than you... so <strong> #NoNepotism </strong> (fun-fact: Nepotism comes from a Latin word which literally means nephew, no wonder it is so prevalent in BollyWood. xD)<br><br>
<strong>2) The composition of the CORE team:-</strong> So the first thing "THE CORE TEAM IS NOT PERMANENT", if someone underperforms then as per the guidelines issued by DSC, they will be immediately replaced. I have decided to keep the composition of the CORE team as follows: 2 for ML, 1 for Android, 1 for DSA, 1 for Web-Development, 1 Designing Lead, 1 Editorial Lead, 1 Outreach Lead, and 1 additional Co-Lead. Note that this composition is not fixed and is subjected to change as per future events(i.e addition of Unity Developers or Cloud-Domain developers). All the posts will be filled by applicants evaluated by the google forms which you filled. And due to such a small size of the CORE team, only the best candidates will be selected.<br><br>
<strong>3)</strong> <strong> Regarding the CORE team and the volunteers:-</strong> See the CORE team and the volunteers are <strong>one-and-the-same</strong> , the only difference? CORE members will communicate the necessary instructions to the Lead. There is NO CORPORATE type hierarchy at DSC, and thus a being a CORE team member doesn't make you the head of other people. It has been recommended by Google Developers to form a CORE team just for the smooth functioning of the DSC in the campus. So please just don't bother yourself with the fact "Yaar mere dost ka Core team me selection ho gaya, and I was not able to make it :(". Both of you will write "Member of DSC-NITA on LinkedIn".<br><br>
<strong>4) What's next:-</strong> Usually after the application form filling, which of course does not happens in this manner at other institutes xD, there is a walk-in interview, but due to the pandemic we've been recommended to forgo the interview process. I'll keep you updated regarding this. <br><br>
<strong>5) This is the first time we've got DSC at our campus</strong>, infact I believe this is the first DSC in NE India (along with NIT-Silchar), so we may not be able to achieve all the big things like other matured DSCs in the world(especially in this pandemic), but atleast we can keep the slope of the development graph positive.<br>
</p>
<p>
I guess that's all. In case of any queries feel free to reach out to me(only on LinkedIn) :D.<br><br>

P.S.: The majority of you voted for COLDPLAY, thanks for that :p.<br><br>

Yours truly, <br>
Ayush Singh<br>
